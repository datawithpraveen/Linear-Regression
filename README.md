# Linear-Regression
# 📈 Linear Regression Projects

This repository contains two regression analysis projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Simple Linear Regression** on student scores based on study hours.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict petrol consumption based on various factors.

## 🧪 Project 1: Simple Linear Regression

### 🔍 Objective
To predict a student's score based on the number of hours they studied.

### 📂 Dataset
- **Columns**: `Hours`, `Scores`
- Source: [You can mention source or just say "Synthetic dataset"]

### 📊 Techniques Used
- Data visualization (scatter plot)
- Correlation analysis
- Simple Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`

### 📈 Key Output
- Regression equation: `Score = m * Hours + b`
- R² score for model performance
- Visualization of regression line on scatter plot

## 🧪 Project 2: Multiple Linear Regression

### 🔍 Objective
To predict **Petrol Consumption** based on multiple socioeconomic and infrastructure-related features.

### 📂 Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `Petrol_tax`
  - `Average_income`
  - `Paved_Highways`
  - `Population_Driver_licence(%)`
- **Target**: `Petrol_Consumption`

### 📊 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- Multiple Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`
- Model evaluation (R² score, coefficients)

### 📈 Key Output
- Regression formula with coefficients
- Insights on which features most affect petrol consumption
